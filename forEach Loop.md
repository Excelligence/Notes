### forEach Loop

array=[1,8,20,5];

array.forEach(function(element){

â€‹    console.log(element)

});

Here the output will be

1

8

20

5

Here the element can be anything like for eg i,x,number etc.

Normally we give meaningful names to the array and the element. Plural name like tasks,numbers etc for array and singular name like number,task etc. for the value of current element.

In this particular example the nodelist returned by querySelectorAll contains task items. So we refer them by the name task.
