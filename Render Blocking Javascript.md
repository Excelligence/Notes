### Render Blocking Javascript

 <script src="app.js">
    </script></head>

+ when we add script tag in head like this it will block page rendering and slow the site loading.

+ It may also cause errors as have seen 

*Code*

`document.getElementById('form').addEventListener('submit',function(e){`

*Error*

`Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'addEventListener' of null
â€‹    at app.js:13`

+ I think this error was caused because the javascript was parsed before the html form part.

To solve this the old way of doing it is to bring your external script referencing to end of closing body tag



<script src="app.js">
    </script>
</body>



The new way of doing is to add async in your script tag and include your script tag in head

 <script async src="app.js">
    </script></head>
